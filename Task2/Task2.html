    <p class="para">Rishi Sunak  born 12 May 1980, is a British politician who has served as Prime Minister of the United Kingdom and Leader of the Conservative Party since October 2022. He previously held various Cabinet positions under prime ministers Theresa May and Boris Johnson, lastly as Chancellor of the Exchequer from 2020 to 2022. He has been Member of Parliament (MP) for Richmond (Yorks) since 2015.

Sunak was born in Southampton to parents of Indian descent who migrated to Britain from East Africa in the 1960s. He was educated at Winchester College, studied philosophy, politics and economics (PPE) at Lincoln College, Oxford, and earned an MBA from Stanford University as a Fulbright Scholar. While at Stanford, he met his future wife Akshata Murty, the daughter of Indian billionaire N. R. Narayana Murthy of Infosys. After graduating, Sunak worked for Goldman Sachs and later as a partner at the hedge fund firms The Children's Investment Fund Management and Theleme Partners. Sunak was elected to the House of Commons for Richmond in North Yorkshire at the 2015 general election, succeeding former Conservative Party leader William Hague. As a backbencher, Sunak supported Brexit in the 2016 referendum on EU membership, and the following year wrote a report advocating the creation of a retail bond market for small and medium-sized enterprises.

Sunak was appointed to May's second government as Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Local Government in the 2018 cabinet reshuffle, and voted three times in favour of May's Brexit withdrawal agreement. After May resigned in 2019, Sunak supported Johnson's successful bid to become Conservative leader and prime minister, after which he appointed Sunak as Chief Secretary to the Treasury in July 2019. Johnson promoted Sunak to Chancellor of the Exchequer in the 2020 cabinet reshuffle after the resignation of Sajid Javid. During his time in the position, Sunak was prominent in the government's financial response to the COVID-19 pandemic and its economic impact, including the Coronavirus Job Retention and Eat Out to Help Out schemes. He was also involved in the government's response to the ongoing cost of living crisis and energy supply crisis.

Sunak stood in the July-September Conservative Party leadership election to succeed Johnson, who resigned amid a prior government crisis. He had received the most votes in each of the series of MP votes, but lost the members' vote to Liz Truss. Following a stint on the backbenches during Truss's premiership, Sunak stood in the October 2022 Conservative Party leadership election to succeed Truss, who resigned amid a government crisis. He was elected unopposed as Leader of the Conservative Party on 24 October 2022, and was appointed Prime Minister by King Charles III a day later, becoming the first British Asian and Hindu to hold the position of Prime Minister. Sunak took office amid the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine and the UK cost of living crisis<br>
